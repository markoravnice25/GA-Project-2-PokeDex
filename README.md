# Project 2: PokeDex!

## Overview

This application contains a:

1) home page;
2) an index page;
3) a show page.

The  user searches for a Pokémon of their choice from 1126 Pokémon available in the index page. They are then led to the show page which displays the individual Pokémon's characteristics, including: Pokémon stats; moves; picture; to what character the Pokémon can evolve to.

## Brief

This project was a two day paired hackathon. I worked with Rob and our task was to create a working application with several components and a router, the application is to consume a public API and present the requests by a user on the application.

## Planning

I wanted to consume a football APi as I'm interested in that field; Rob preferred a Pokémon API as Pokémon were a big part of his childhood. We decided to go for the Pokémon API as it was far more detailed, it had a seeming never ending array of possibilities in regards to the amount of data which we could fetch. The API allowed for GET requests only, so we won't going to add (POST), update (PUT) or remove (DELETE) any data.

Link to the API: https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon/

Link to the API documentation: https://pokeapi.co/docs/v2#pokemon

Upon deciding on the Pokémon API , we created a wireframe planning out the visuals of the site and the functionality.
